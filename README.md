### Welcome on my GitHub page 👋🏼

I am currently working as a Product Engineer @ Moneybird in the Netherlands (accounting software platform using Ruby on Rails, @jsmienk-moneybird). I have studied Interaction Technology at University Twente in the Netherlands 🇳🇱. Which is about how people interact with technology and how to design solutions for all people using (especially) newer technology 🤖. Tools taught include Human-Centred Design, Data Science, Machine Learning, Multi-Agent Systems, Computer Vision, Information Retrieval, Virtual Reality, Text and Speech Processing, Sports Technology, Computer Ethics, and to design for behaviour change. I took some financial courses on the side that include Strategic Technology Management and Innovation, and Entrepreneurial Finance. My Master's is a lot more theoretical than my Bachelor's in Software Engineering and most of the repositories here are from these times or some hobby projects from years ago.
